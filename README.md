# EatDaBurger

This is a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). This uses the MVC design pattern; using Node and MySQL to query and route data, and Handlebars (templating software) to generate the HTML.

## Challenges

This application uses the MVC architecture and a handmade ORM, no sequalize in this one. Getting to understand the flow of data inside of the MVC architecture was the biggest challenge. Also deploying the app and the database was also an interesting challenge to overcome. Thanks to JawsDB it was a much easier task.
